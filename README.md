# auto-scaling-azure-sql-using-azure-automation
A fixed PowerShell script of [Jorg Klein's Azure SQL auto-scaling using Azure Automation](https://jorgklein.com/2017/09/19/azure-sql-database-scheduled-autoscaling/).

The version in Jorg Klein's blog has a few issues with the " delimmiter. All credit for this script belows to Jorg Klein. The only thing I did was fix the delimmiters so they run correctly.
